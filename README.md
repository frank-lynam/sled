# sled
Frank's Starfield Linux ES\* Deployer

## Usage

Download plugins as .zip or whatever and put them in `enabled/` and run `python3 sled.py`

If you don't have SFSE, you'll need it, and this sets it up for you. Just download the 7z file into the enabled folder and it'll walk you through it.

If you want up update SFSE, add it in there and run `python3 sled.py sfse`
